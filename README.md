# Task manager

Novius OS is an Open Source PHP Content Management System designed as an applications platform, hence the ‘OS’ suffix. Check out [Novius OS’ readme](http://github.com/novius-os/novius-os#readme) for more info.

The ‘Task manager’ application for Novius OS allows you to easily manage your
[tasks](http://fuelphp.com/docs/general/tasks.html). You can launch them using an URL; it can be useful if you are on a
shared hosting service and you want to use crons.
